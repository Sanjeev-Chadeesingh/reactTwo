    create-react-app projectName
    Starting CRA - npm start from project directory
    Stopping CRA - control+C

    delete everything in src file
    touch index.js
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    const Component()
    ReactDOM.render(<Component />,  document.getElementById('root'))

    A react component is a function or a class that produces HTML using JSX and handles feedback from the user using event handlers 

    JSX!
       single brackets for variables, double for object then variables  
       can't reference object in jsx unless properly notated
       check chrome console for bugs regarding html conversion with attributes

    3 Tenets of Components!
        Component Nesting-they can be shown inside one another
        Component Reusability-they should be reused throughout an app
        Component Configuration-we should be able to configure a component when it is created

        Props!
            system for passing data from a parent component to a child component
                from parent(provider) to child(consumer):
                <CommentDetail propName="propValue" />
            goal is to customize or configure a child component 

            CommentDetail+ApprovalCard  
                we added ApprovalCard component, and wrapped CommentDetail in it. Now, when we log the children props of the ApprovalCard, it has inherited the props of the CommentDetail component as its children props

                commentdetail has now been passed as a prop to the approvalcard, via the wrapping. pass props.children into the content of approvalcard, and now the commentdetail is showing up within the approvalcard
